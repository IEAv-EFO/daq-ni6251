**Labview diff tool will only work with Professional Development system License.**

Git and LabVIEW can work together to show the diff by using the [LVMerge.vi or LVMerge.exe](https://www.ni.com/docs/en-US/bundle/labview/page/lvhowto/configmerge_thirdparty.html) integrated with your local git installation.

The setup can be done by a shell of the [kind](https://gitlab.com/sas-blog/LVCompare-Merge-Setup).
